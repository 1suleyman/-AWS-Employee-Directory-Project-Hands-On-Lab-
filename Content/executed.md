# Project Execution: AWS 3-Tier Employee Directory Application

Welcome to the hands-on execution log of my **AWS 3-Tier Employee Directory Web Application Project**.  
This file documents the **exact steps I took** ‚Äî from IAM setup to Auto Scaling ‚Äî to bring this application to life on AWS, module by module.

Think of this as a **behind-the-scenes build journal** that tracks not just what I planned to do ‚Äî but what I actually did, validated, and learned.

---

## üß† What You‚Äôll Find Here

‚úÖ **Completed modules** with verified setups  
üñºÔ∏è **Screenshots and config details** of my AWS Console setup  
üß™ **Tests and validations** of the deployed infrastructure  
üì¶ **Cleanup and cost-saving practices** at every stage

Each section below matches the structure of my [planned project guide](./planned.md) ‚Äî but this version focuses purely on implementation and results.

---

## üìã Execution Modules

- **üöÄ Module 1:** IAM Setup (Users, Groups, Roles, MFA, Access Keys)  
- **üöÄ Module 2:** Launching the App on EC2 (Networking, User Data, Web Server)  
- **üåê Module 3:** Custom VPC with Subnets, Route Tables, and Re-deployment  
- **üíæ Module 4:** S3 Bucket for Profile Photos + IAM Policy Integration  
- **üóÑÔ∏è Module 5:** DynamoDB Table Setup + Full CRUD Test via App UI  
- **üìà Module 6:** Load Balancing and EC2 Auto Scaling Configuration + Stress Test

Each module ends with real validation: "Did it work?" If so, ‚úÖ. If not, I tracked the fix.

---

## üîç Why Document Execution?

Writing this was part of my **learning-through-doing** approach. I didn‚Äôt just read about AWS ‚Äî I built something, broke things, fixed them, and learned *why* each service mattered.

If you're building a similar app, studying for AWS certs, or want to understand how these services connect in practice, this log is for you.

## üöÄ Module 1: IAM Setup

---

### üîß IAM Setup

---
- [x] Enable **MFA for the AWS root user**
---

![Screenshot 2025-07-08 at 11 32 58](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8bc278e4-5b3f-42da-804b-9aafab5bd768)

---
- [x]¬†Create IAM **admin user** (e.g. `AdminUser`)
---

**üß† Question: Should I Give Console Access to My AdminUser?**

![Screenshot 2025-07-08 at 12 13 16](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66d576de-97b5-4cb8-8edf-4ddc336f17ac)

Once I got to this stage ‚Äî creating my IAM admin user ‚Äî I paused to ask myself:

> **‚ÄúShould I provide user access to the AWS Management Console or not?‚Äù**

This is an important decision depending on how I plan to interact with AWS.

**ü§î Should AdminUser Have Console Access?**

**‚úÖ YES ‚Äì Enable Console Access if:**

- I want to **manually deploy, troubleshoot, or inspect** services in the AWS UI.
- I‚Äôm following this **guided lab course**, which includes **demoing in the console**.
- I need to **reset passwords**, configure IAM users, VPCs, and other settings through the browser.
- I‚Äôm the **only person managing this AWS account**, so I need full UI access.

**‚ùå NO ‚Äì Don‚Äôt Enable Console Access if:**

- I‚Äôm using this IAM user purely for **automation or infrastructure-as-code** (e.g. CloudFormation, Bicep, Terraform).
- I have a **CI/CD pipeline or SDK-based script** doing the work instead of me.
- I want to **enforce least privilege** and avoid storing browser login credentials.

**‚öñÔ∏è My Use Case (for This Project)**

Since this is a **hands-on, manually driven project**, where I‚Äôm:

- Deploying and testing services like **EC2, IAM, S3, and DynamoDB**
- Using the **AWS Management Console**
- Learning step-by-step before moving into automation

**‚úÖ My Choice**

I chose to **enable AWS Management Console access** for the AdminUser.
This gives me the flexibility to:

- Log in and use the browser-based AWS UI
- Perform tasks manually as I follow the lab instructions

Later on, I can rotate to programmatic-only access when I start automating or building infrastructure as code.

**üåç Question: Why Is IAM Identity Center Defaulting to US East (N. Virginia)**

![Screenshot 2025-07-08 at 12 32 43](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a2c95e8-3b3d-47dd-95e6-e60c3f988b15)

After I selected:

> **"Are you providing console access to a person?"**  
> and saw the message:  
> _‚ÄúWe recommend that you use Identity Center to provide console access to a person...‚Äù_

![Screenshot 2025-07-08 at 12 39 34](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cda9637a-3ec0-411f-9ce5-2a5ec6dc8616)

I continued to the **IAM Identity Center setup** under **AWS Organizations**, but something confused me:

> **Why is it defaulting to `US East (N. Virginia)` as the current AWS Region, even though I‚Äôm based in London?**

**üìå What I Learned**

- **IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO)** is a **global service**, but it needs a **home Region** to store identity-related configurations.
- As of now, **`us-east-1` (N. Virginia)** is the only supported Region for setting up IAM Identity Center.
- This Region is **not changeable**, even if your main AWS infrastructure is located in another Region (like `eu-west-2` for London).
- The Identity Center setup and assignments are global ‚Äî **but the backend data is stored in N. Virginia**.

**‚öôÔ∏è How It Affects This Project**

- My **compute, storage, and database resources** are all in the London (`eu-west-2`) Region.
- IAM Identity Center being locked to `us-east-1` does **not block or conflict** with my project.
- I can still:
  - Assign users access to AWS accounts across any Region
  - Manage permissions for services like EC2, S3, and DynamoDB within my local Region

**‚úÖ Conclusion**

Although it feels unintuitive, this is the current AWS design.  
I went ahead and used IAM Identity Center in `us-east-1`, knowing it won‚Äôt interfere with my London-based infrastructure.

**üîê Question: Should I Use an Autogenerated or Custom Password for the AdminUser?**

When creating the `AdminUser`, I reached the **"Console password"** section, where AWS gives two options:

> **Autogenerated password**  
> You can view the password after you create the user.

> **Custom password**  
> You enter a password manually now (must be 8+ characters with at least 3 of: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)

There‚Äôs also a checkbox:  
> ‚úÖ **Users must create a new password at next sign-in (Recommended)**

**üß† What I Considered**

**‚úÖ Autogenerated Password ‚Äì Good if:**
- You want **maximum randomness** and **strong security** by default
- You're okay with copying and saving the password temporarily
- You're **sharing the credentials** securely with someone else
- You **want the user to reset it anyway** at first login (via the recommended checkbox)

**üîì Custom Password ‚Äì Good if:**
- You're the one using the account and want something easy to **remember temporarily**
- You're doing **short-term lab work** and don‚Äôt want to reset a password immediately
- You want to **avoid the "reset password on first login" step**

**‚úÖ My Choice**

Since I‚Äôm doing **solo hands-on work** and managing everything myself:

- I used a **custom password** that I could remember quickly
- I **unchecked** the ‚Äúmust reset password on next sign-in‚Äù box to avoid extra steps
- I made sure the password was strong enough to meet AWS requirements

> Later, when the lab is complete, I can always reset the password or rotate credentials

---
- [x] Access the app via the EC2 public IP address
---

**üß≠ What Just Happened (My Summary)**

After launching my EC2 instance, I tried accessing the app using the public IP address ‚Äî but I hit this error:

‚ùå This site can‚Äôt be reached
13.41.53.236 refused to connect
ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED

That told me the app wasn‚Äôt running ‚Äî most likely because the User Data launch script failed.

I checked /var/log/cloud-init-output.log and realized I never replaced this line in the script:

```bash
wget https://<YOUR_BUCKET>.s3.amazonaws.com/employee-app.zip
```

Because <YOUR_BUCKET> wasn‚Äôt updated with a real S3 bucket name, the EC2 instance failed to:

- Download the zip file
- Unzip the app
- Install the dependencies
- Start the Flask server

Basically, the app never launched ‚Äî so there was nothing for the public IP to respond with.

**üîÑ My Pivot: Serve a Static Website Instead**
Instead of chasing down a public bucket or recreating the Flask app zip file, I asked:

< ‚ÄúCan I just serve a basic HTML page from this EC2 instance instead?‚Äù

Turns out ‚Äî **yes**. So I pivoted to testing my infrastructure setup by serving a static HTML page via Apache (httpd).

**‚úÖ Working User Data Script (Static Site)**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd

# Create a simple HTML page
cat <<EOF > /var/www/html/index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First EC2 Website</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>üéâ Hello from EC2!</h1>
  <p>This static website was launched with a User Data script.</p>
</body>
</html>
EOF
```

**‚úÖ EC2 Static Website Launched Successfully**

After correcting my User Data script and launching a fresh instance (`employee-directory-app-2`), I was able to:

- After launching a new instance (employee-directory-app-2) with the updated User Data, I was able to:
- Confirm httpd was installed and running: systemctl status httpd
- See that /var/www/html/index.html was created correctly
- Run curl http://localhost and curl http://<Public IP> ‚Äî both returned the HTML
- Open the site in an Incognito browser window (fixed caching issues from earlier attempts)
- See the site load with a "Not Secure" message (expected with HTTP on port 80

üéâ The EC2 instance now serves my static website from user data!

---
- [x] Confirm the Employee Directory loads (empty state)

> ‚úÖ Reminder: Subnets are only considered "public" if they are associated with a route table that connects them to an Internet Gateway.

**üîÑ Preparing the Flask App for EC2 Deployment**

Since I didn‚Äôt have access to the original employee-app.zip used in the AWS Technical Essentials course, I decided to recreate the Flask application myself using Gemini. My goal was to:

- üéØ Recreate the employee directory app structure locally
- üì¶ Zip it and upload to my own S3 bucket
- üìù Reference it in EC2 User Data script
- üöÄ Relaunch the app into my custom VPC using Amazon EC2

**üìÅ Step 1: Build the Flask App Locally** 

I used Gemini to generate a simple Flask app that includes:

```
employee-app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ application.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ static/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css
```

**üóúÔ∏è Step 2: Zip the Application**

```bash
cd employee-app
zip -r employee-app.zip .
```

This creates a employee-app.zip file with all the necessary code and folders inside.

**‚òÅÔ∏è Step 3: Upload to Amazon S3**

---
- [x] Go to the S3 console

---
- [x] Click Create bucket
  - Give it a unique name (e.g. employee-flask-app)
  - Choose the same Region as your EC2 instance (e.g. eu-west-2)
  - Leave the default settings (Block public access ON is fine for now)
---

**üîê Making My S3 Zip File Public for EC2 User Data**
When I got to this stage, I asked myself:

> ‚ÄúDo I need to disable Block Public Access in my S3 bucket to let EC2 download my employee-app.zip file using wget?‚Äù

After a bit of digging, here‚Äôs what I learned üëá

**‚úÖ Yes ‚Äî if I want EC2 to download the file using a public URL**
By default, S3 buckets block all public access, which is great for security ‚Äî but that also means my EC2 instance won‚Äôt be able to download my file using:

```bash
wget https://my-bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com/employee-app.zip
```

Unless I explicitly make that file public, the download will silently fail during the launch process.

---
- [x] Open the newly created bucket
---

![Screenshot 2025-07-09 at 12 21 40](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d1fba15-81ec-4b6e-9d78-51632a043f9f)

---
- [x] Click Upload ‚Üí Add files
  - Upload your employee-app.zip file
  - Opened the Object actions dropdown ‚ùå (I had to find another solution, which you will see!)
  - Chose **"Make public"** to allow access only to that specific file ‚ùå (I had to find another solution, which you will see!)

**üõ†Ô∏è Making employee-app.zip Public (Using a Bucket Policy Instead of ACL)**

After uploading my employee-app.zip file to S3, I needed to make it publicly accessible so my EC2 instance could download it as part of the **User Data script**.

At first, I tried to use the **‚ÄúMake public using ACL‚Äù** option on the file ‚Äî but it was greyed out.

![Screenshot 2025-07-09 at 12 27 42](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0e4067b-5518-442d-8a0e-e299892cf8e1)

So here‚Äôs what I did instead:

**üîê Adjusting Bucket Permissions (via Policy)**

1. I went to the Permissions tab of the bucket.
2. Clicked Edit under Block Public Access (bucket settings).
3. I unchecked this one setting:

```
Block public and cross-account access to buckets and objects through any public bucket or access point policies
```

> This setting was preventing even valid bucket policies from allowing public access.

4. Then I scrolled to the **Bucket Policy** section and added the following:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadForObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::employee-flask-app/employee-app.zip"
    }
 ]
}
```

5. I saved the changes and copied the **Object URL** for the file (found under the file‚Äôs details).
6. Finally, I opened a **private/incognito browser tab**, pasted the URL, and‚Ä¶ ‚úÖ it worked! The browser downloaded the .zip file with no errors.

This confirms that the file is now publicly accessible **(only that one file)** ‚Äî and I‚Äôm ready to use this link inside my EC2 User Data script.

---
- [x] After upload completes:
  - Click on the file
  - Under Object URL, copy the link ‚Äî for example:
---

```bash
https://employee-flask-app.s3.amazonaws.com/employee-app.zip
```
**üéØ Why This Works:**
This lets my EC2 instance pull the zip file with wget during boot, **without making the whole bucket public.**
Just one secure, targeted object permission ‚Äî clean and minimal.

Now I‚Äôm ready to paste that URL into the EC2 **User Data script** for the next step!

**üìù Step 4: Update the EC2 User Data Script**

Update the launch script to pull your real .zip file from S3:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd /home/ec2-user
wget https://employee-flask-app.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/employee-app.zip
unzip employee-app.zip
cd employee-app
yum install python3 -y
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
yum install stress -y
export PHOTOS_BUCKET=employee-photo-bucket-sr963
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2
export DYNAMO_MODE=on
python3 application.py
```

**üöÄ Step 5: Relaunch EC2 with Updated Script**

In the AWS EC2 Console:

1. Go to Instances ‚Üí click new instance
2. Rename it: employee-directory-app-networking-module
3. Choose:
  - Instance type: `t2.micro`
  - Proceed without key pair
  - VPC: app-vpc
  - Subnet: Public Subnet 1
  - Auto-assign Public IP: ‚úÖ Enabled
4. Paste your updated User Data into the Advanced Details section
- [x] Created new security group for `app-sg`
  - Inbound rules:
    - HTTP (port 80) from anywhere
    - HTTPS (port 443) from anywhere
    - ssh (port 22) from anywhere
  5. Attach IAM role: EmployeeWebAppRole
    - Grants EC2 instance access to S3 and DynamoDB

**üòÆ‚Äçüí® Step 6: When the Flask App Still Didn‚Äôt Work‚Ä¶**

After following all the steps ‚Äî zipping up my Flask app, making the S3 object public, launching the EC2 instance with the correct IAM role and security group ‚Äî I was so sure it would finally work.

But‚Ä¶

```
‚ùå This site can‚Äôt be reached  
18.133.156.203 refused to connect.  
ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
```

At this point, I genuinely wanted to shed a tear.

I had been battling Gemini‚Äôs AI-generated Flask code for nearly **2 hours** ‚Äî tweaking the structure, rewriting the application.py, rebuilding the zip, fixing the User Data script, redeploying, and still... nothing.

**üß† Lesson: Sometimes Google > AI**

In a last-ditch effort, I Googled:

> ‚ÄúAWS Technical Essentials Flask code‚Äù

And boom üí• ‚Äî I found a course article that included **the exact User Data script** used in the original training materials.

**‚úÖ The Working User Data Script (Finally!)**

```bash
#!/bin/bash -ex 
wget https://aws-tc-largeobjects.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/DEV-AWS-MO-GCNv2/FlaskApp.zip 
unzip FlaskApp.zip 
cd FlaskApp/ 
yum -y install python3 
yum -y install python3-pip 
pip install -r requirements.txt 
yum -y install stress 
export PHOTOS_BUCKET=employee-flask-app
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=eu-west-2
export DYNAMO_MODE=on 
FLASK_APP=application.py /usr/local/bin/flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=80
```

**üéâ And It Worked!**

I updated the User Data with this version, launched a new EC2 instance, and visited the public IP:

> ‚úÖ The Flask Employee Directory loaded perfectly in my browser!

**üìå Key Takeaway**

Sometimes, instead of debugging generated code for hours, a simple Google search can save the day ‚Äî just like the good ol‚Äô StackOverflow era.

I stressed the cpu for 5 mins, this is going to allow me to stress my CPU to get it above that 60 percent threshold and launch new instances. 

As result 2 new instances was launched in response to the scaling action that is happening because of the CPU stress that I initiated.

So these instances will be launched and then they will be added to the group of instances that are part of the entire fleet.
