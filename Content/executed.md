# Project Execution: AWS 3-Tier Employee Directory Application

Welcome to the hands-on execution log of my **AWS 3-Tier Employee Directory Web Application Project**.  
This file documents the **exact steps I took** ‚Äî from IAM setup to Auto Scaling ‚Äî to bring this application to life on AWS, module by module.

Think of this as a **behind-the-scenes build journal** that tracks not just what I planned to do ‚Äî but what I actually did, validated, and learned.

---

## üß† What You‚Äôll Find Here

‚úÖ **Completed modules** with verified setups  
üñºÔ∏è **Screenshots and config details** of my AWS Console setup  
üß™ **Tests and validations** of the deployed infrastructure  
üì¶ **Cleanup and cost-saving practices** at every stage

Each section below matches the structure of my [planned project guide](./planned.md) ‚Äî but this version focuses purely on implementation and results.

---

## üìã Execution Modules

- **üöÄ Module 1:** IAM Setup (Users, Groups, Roles, MFA, Access Keys)  
- **üöÄ Module 2:** Launching the App on EC2 (Networking, User Data, Web Server)  
- **üåê Module 3:** Custom VPC with Subnets, Route Tables, and Re-deployment  
- **üíæ Module 4:** S3 Bucket for Profile Photos + IAM Policy Integration  
- **üóÑÔ∏è Module 5:** DynamoDB Table Setup + Full CRUD Test via App UI  
- **üìà Module 6:** Load Balancing and EC2 Auto Scaling Configuration + Stress Test

Each module ends with real validation: "Did it work?" If so, ‚úÖ. If not, I tracked the fix.

---

## üîç Why Document Execution?

Writing this was part of my **learning-through-doing** approach. I didn‚Äôt just read about AWS ‚Äî I built something, broke things, fixed them, and learned *why* each service mattered.

If you're building a similar app, studying for AWS certs, or want to understand how these services connect in practice, this log is for you.

## üöÄ Module 1: IAM Setup

---

### üîß IAM Setup

---
- [x] Enable **MFA for the AWS root user**
---

![Screenshot 2025-07-08 at 11 32 58](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8bc278e4-5b3f-42da-804b-9aafab5bd768)

---
- [x]¬†Create IAM **admin user** (e.g. `AdminUser`)
---

**üß† Question: Should I Give Console Access to My AdminUser?**

![Screenshot 2025-07-08 at 12 13 16](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66d576de-97b5-4cb8-8edf-4ddc336f17ac)

Once I got to this stage ‚Äî creating my IAM admin user ‚Äî I paused to ask myself:

> **‚ÄúShould I provide user access to the AWS Management Console or not?‚Äù**

This is an important decision depending on how I plan to interact with AWS.

**ü§î Should AdminUser Have Console Access?**

**‚úÖ YES ‚Äì Enable Console Access if:**

- I want to **manually deploy, troubleshoot, or inspect** services in the AWS UI.
- I‚Äôm following this **guided lab course**, which includes **demoing in the console**.
- I need to **reset passwords**, configure IAM users, VPCs, and other settings through the browser.
- I‚Äôm the **only person managing this AWS account**, so I need full UI access.

**‚ùå NO ‚Äì Don‚Äôt Enable Console Access if:**

- I‚Äôm using this IAM user purely for **automation or infrastructure-as-code** (e.g. CloudFormation, Bicep, Terraform).
- I have a **CI/CD pipeline or SDK-based script** doing the work instead of me.
- I want to **enforce least privilege** and avoid storing browser login credentials.

**‚öñÔ∏è My Use Case (for This Project)**

Since this is a **hands-on, manually driven project**, where I‚Äôm:

- Deploying and testing services like **EC2, IAM, S3, and DynamoDB**
- Using the **AWS Management Console**
- Learning step-by-step before moving into automation

**‚úÖ My Choice**

I chose to **enable AWS Management Console access** for the AdminUser.
This gives me the flexibility to:

- Log in and use the browser-based AWS UI
- Perform tasks manually as I follow the lab instructions

Later on, I can rotate to programmatic-only access when I start automating or building infrastructure as code.

**üåç Question: Why Is IAM Identity Center Defaulting to US East (N. Virginia)**

![Screenshot 2025-07-08 at 12 32 43](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a2c95e8-3b3d-47dd-95e6-e60c3f988b15)

After I selected:

> **"Are you providing console access to a person?"**  
> and saw the message:  
> _‚ÄúWe recommend that you use Identity Center to provide console access to a person...‚Äù_

![Screenshot 2025-07-08 at 12 39 34](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cda9637a-3ec0-411f-9ce5-2a5ec6dc8616)

I continued to the **IAM Identity Center setup** under **AWS Organizations**, but something confused me:

> **Why is it defaulting to `US East (N. Virginia)` as the current AWS Region, even though I‚Äôm based in London?**

**üìå What I Learned**

- **IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO)** is a **global service**, but it needs a **home Region** to store identity-related configurations.
- As of now, **`us-east-1` (N. Virginia)** is the only supported Region for setting up IAM Identity Center.
- This Region is **not changeable**, even if your main AWS infrastructure is located in another Region (like `eu-west-2` for London).
- The Identity Center setup and assignments are global ‚Äî **but the backend data is stored in N. Virginia**.

**‚öôÔ∏è How It Affects This Project**

- My **compute, storage, and database resources** are all in the London (`eu-west-2`) Region.
- IAM Identity Center being locked to `us-east-1` does **not block or conflict** with my project.
- I can still:
  - Assign users access to AWS accounts across any Region
  - Manage permissions for services like EC2, S3, and DynamoDB within my local Region

**‚úÖ Conclusion**

Although it feels unintuitive, this is the current AWS design.  
I went ahead and used IAM Identity Center in `us-east-1`, knowing it won‚Äôt interfere with my London-based infrastructure.

**üîê Question: Should I Use an Autogenerated or Custom Password for the AdminUser?**

When creating the `AdminUser`, I reached the **"Console password"** section, where AWS gives two options:

> **Autogenerated password**  
> You can view the password after you create the user.

> **Custom password**  
> You enter a password manually now (must be 8+ characters with at least 3 of: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)

There‚Äôs also a checkbox:  
> ‚úÖ **Users must create a new password at next sign-in (Recommended)**

**üß† What I Considered**

**‚úÖ Autogenerated Password ‚Äì Good if:**
- You want **maximum randomness** and **strong security** by default
- You're okay with copying and saving the password temporarily
- You're **sharing the credentials** securely with someone else
- You **want the user to reset it anyway** at first login (via the recommended checkbox)

**üîì Custom Password ‚Äì Good if:**
- You're the one using the account and want something easy to **remember temporarily**
- You're doing **short-term lab work** and don‚Äôt want to reset a password immediately
- You want to **avoid the "reset password on first login" step**

**‚úÖ My Choice**

Since I‚Äôm doing **solo hands-on work** and managing everything myself:

- I used a **custom password** that I could remember quickly
- I **unchecked** the ‚Äúmust reset password on next sign-in‚Äù box to avoid extra steps
- I made sure the password was strong enough to meet AWS requirements

> Later, when the lab is complete, I can always reset the password or rotate credentials

---
- [x] Access the app via the EC2 public IP address
---

**üß≠ What Just Happened (My Summary)**

After launching my EC2 instance, I tried accessing the app using the public IP address ‚Äî but I hit this error:

‚ùå This site can‚Äôt be reached
13.41.53.236 refused to connect
ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED

That told me the app wasn‚Äôt running ‚Äî most likely because the User Data launch script failed.

I checked /var/log/cloud-init-output.log and realized I never replaced this line in the script:

```bash
wget https://<YOUR_BUCKET>.s3.amazonaws.com/employee-app.zip
```

Because <YOUR_BUCKET> wasn‚Äôt updated with a real S3 bucket name, the EC2 instance failed to:

- Download the zip file
- Unzip the app
- Install the dependencies
- Start the Flask server

Basically, the app never launched ‚Äî so there was nothing for the public IP to respond with.

**üîÑ My Pivot: Serve a Static Website Instead**
Instead of chasing down a public bucket or recreating the Flask app zip file, I asked:

< ‚ÄúCan I just serve a basic HTML page from this EC2 instance instead?‚Äù

Turns out ‚Äî **yes**. So I pivoted to testing my infrastructure setup by serving a static HTML page via Apache (httpd).

**‚úÖ Working User Data Script (Static Site)**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd

# Create a simple HTML page
cat <<EOF > /var/www/html/index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First EC2 Website</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>üéâ Hello from EC2!</h1>
  <p>This static website was launched with a User Data script.</p>
</body>
</html>
EOF
```

**‚úÖ EC2 Static Website Launched Successfully**

After correcting my User Data script and launching a fresh instance (`employee-directory-app-2`), I was able to:

- After launching a new instance (employee-directory-app-2) with the updated User Data, I was able to:
- Confirm httpd was installed and running: systemctl status httpd
- See that /var/www/html/index.html was created correctly
- Run curl http://localhost and curl http://<Public IP> ‚Äî both returned the HTML
- Open the site in an Incognito browser window (fixed caching issues from earlier attempts)
- See the site load with a "Not Secure" message (expected with HTTP on port 80

üéâ The EC2 instance now serves my static website from user data!

---
- [x] Confirm the Employee Directory loads (empty state)
