# 📂 Executed: My Hands-On AWS Project Walkthrough

Welcome to the hands-on execution log of my **AWS 3-Tier Employee Directory Web Application Project**.  
This file documents the **exact steps I took** — from IAM setup to Auto Scaling — to bring this application to life on AWS, module by module.

Think of this as a **behind-the-scenes build journal** that tracks not just what I planned to do — but what I actually did, validated, and learned.

## 🧠 What You’ll Find Here

✅ **Completed modules** with verified setups  
🖼️ **Screenshots and config details** of my AWS Console setup  
🧪 **Tests and validations** of the deployed infrastructure  
📦 **Cleanup and cost-saving practices** at every stage

Each section below matches the structure of my [planned project guide](./planned.md) — but this version focuses purely on implementation and results.

## 📋 Execution Modules

- **🚀 Module 1:** IAM Setup (Users, Groups, Roles, MFA, Access Keys)  
- **🚀 Module 2:** Launching the App on EC2 (Networking, User Data, Web Server)  
- **🌐 Module 3:** Custom VPC with Subnets, Route Tables, and Re-deployment  
- **💾 Module 4:** S3 Bucket for Profile Photos + IAM Policy Integration  
- **🗄️ Module 5:** DynamoDB Table Setup + Full CRUD Test via App UI  
- **📈 Module 6:** Load Balancing and EC2 Auto Scaling Configuration + Stress Test

Each module ends with real validation: "Did it work?" If so, ✅. If not, I tracked the fix.

## 🔍 Why Document Execution?

Writing this was part of my **learning-through-doing** approach. I didn’t just read about AWS — I built something, broke things, fixed them, and learned *why* each service mattered.

If you're building a similar app, studying for AWS certs, or want to understand how these services connect in practice, this log is for you.
