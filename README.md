# -AWS-Employee-Directory-Project-Hands-On-Lab-

Welcome! This repository documents my hands-on journey through building a **serverless employee directory web application** on AWS. The goal is to apply cloud infrastructure skills by building a real project step-by-step, aligned with AWS best practices.

## üìå Project Goal

Create a secure, scalable employee directory app hosted on AWS using services like:
- IAM
- EC2
- S3
- DynamoDB
- CloudWatch
- Elastic Load Balancing
- Auto Scaling
- API Gateway & Lambda (in later modules)

## ‚úÖ Module Checklist

Each module focuses on a core AWS concept and includes a step-by-step implementation guide I can follow when building the project independently.

---

#### üîß IAM Setup
- [ ] Enable **MFA for the AWS root user**
- [ ] Create IAM **admin user** (e.g. `AdminUser`)
- [ ] Create IAM **group** (e.g. `EC2Admins`)
- [ ] Attach `AmazonEC2FullAccess` policy to the group
- [ ] Add `AdminUser` to the group

#### üß≠ IAM Roles
- [ ] Create IAM **role** (`EmployeeWebAppRole`)
- [ ] Trusted entity type: `EC2`
- [ ] Attach managed policies:
  - [ ] `AmazonS3FullAccess`
  - [ ] `AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess`
- [ ] Review trust relationship: allow only EC2 to assume role

#### üîë IAM Users & Access Keys
- [ ] Create **developer IAM user** (e.g. `DevUser`)
- [ ] Enable console access and force password reset
- [ ] Add user to `EC2Admins` group
- [ ] Create programmatic access keys for AWS CLI use
- [ ] ‚úÖ Delete keys after testing (demo only)
