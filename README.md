## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience designing and deploying a production-style web application using core AWS services.

> 🎯 **Objective**: Build a secure, scalable, and highly available Employee Directory web application on AWS.

This application is built using:
- **Amazon EC2** for compute (web server)
- **Amazon S3** for image storage
- **Amazon DynamoDB** for employee data
- **IAM** for user access and instance roles
- **VPC** for custom networking
- **Elastic Load Balancer** for distributing traffic
- **EC2 Auto Scaling** for dynamic instance scaling
- [Future] **API Gateway + Lambda** for a serverless contact form
