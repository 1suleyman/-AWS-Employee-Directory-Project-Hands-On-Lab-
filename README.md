# -AWS-Employee-Directory-Project-Hands-On-Lab-

Welcome! This repository documents my hands-on journey through building a **serverless employee directory web application** on AWS. The goal is to apply cloud infrastructure skills by building a real project step-by-step, aligned with AWS best practices.

---

## üìå Project Goal

Create a secure, scalable employee directory app hosted on AWS using services like:
- IAM
- EC2
- S3
- DynamoDB
- CloudWatch
- Elastic Load Balancing
- Auto Scaling
- API Gateway & Lambda (in later modules)
