# üßë‚Äçüíª AWS 3-Tier Employee Directory Web Application

Welcome to my personal AWS lab project! This repository documents my step-by-step journey building a **3-Tier Employee Directory Web Application** on AWS using cloud architecture best practices.

---

## üìå Project Overview

The goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience designing, deploying, and scaling a production-style web application using core AWS services.

> üéØ **Objective**: Build a secure, scalable, and highly available Employee Directory web application in the AWS Cloud.

This application is built using:

- **Amazon EC2** for compute (Flask web server)
- **Amazon S3** for storing employee profile photos
- **Amazon DynamoDB** for storing employee data
- **IAM** for secure user access and instance roles
- **Amazon VPC** for custom networking and subnet design
- **Elastic Load Balancer** for distributing web traffic across AZs
- **EC2 Auto Scaling** for dynamic instance management
- **[Planned] API Gateway + AWS Lambda** for a future serverless contact form feature

## üß† What I Learned

This repo documents my end-to-end AWS project where I deployed a real-world, scalable web application using core cloud services. It covers networking, security, storage, compute, and automation ‚Äî built step by step using best practices.

Here‚Äôs what I practiced and learned:

---

### ‚úÖ Identity & Access Management (IAM)
- Enabled MFA on the root user for account protection  
- Created IAM users (`AdminUser`, `DevUser`) with console and programmatic access  
- Assigned least-privilege roles and attached managed policies via IAM groups  
- Created and attached IAM Roles (e.g. `EmployeeWebAppRole`) to EC2 for secure access to S3 and DynamoDB  
- Learned how IAM Identity Center defaults to `us-east-1` as a global service region

---

### ‚úÖ Compute (Amazon EC2)
- Launched EC2 instances using Amazon Linux 2023 and Free Tier instance types  
- Attached IAM roles, security groups, and configured launch scripts (User Data)  
- Used browser-based EC2 Connect instead of SSH keys for secure access  
- Debugged failed EC2 app launches by checking `/var/log/cloud-init-output.log`  
- Used User Data scripts to install dependencies, run Flask, and serve static sites  

---

### ‚úÖ Networking (Amazon VPC)
- Created a custom VPC (`app-vpc`) with a CIDR block of `10.1.0.0/16`  
- Created public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability  
- Attached an Internet Gateway and associated a route table for public internet access  
- Verified proper routing setup and subnet association for internet-facing workloads  

---

### ‚úÖ Storage (Amazon S3)
- Created a private S3 bucket (`employee-photo-bucket-456s`) for photo uploads  
- Uploaded and tested access to image objects  
- Wrote and applied a secure bucket policy allowing only EC2 access via IAM role  
- Validated file uploads using both the app and the S3 console  

---

### ‚úÖ Database (Amazon DynamoDB)
- Created a `Employees` table with partition key `id`  
- Connected the app to DynamoDB using environment variables  
- Tested full-stack integration: photo uploaded to S3, employee data stored in DynamoDB  
- Confirmed write success via app UI and direct console queries  

---

### ‚úÖ Monitoring & Auto Scaling
- Set up an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** across two AZs  
- Created a **Launch Template** and **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** for the app  
- Configured health checks and target groups  
- Implemented target-tracking scaling based on CPU utilization  
- Simulated high CPU load using `/stress-cpu` to trigger automatic scaling  
- Verified that new instances launched and registered automatically under the ALB

---

This project taught me how to design, build, troubleshoot, and scale a full-stack cloud application on AWS. Every decision ‚Äî from IAM to load balancing ‚Äî reinforced key concepts used by real cloud engineers and tested in the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect exams.

It‚Äôs more than just a demo ‚Äî it‚Äôs **proof of hands-on, production-ready skills**.
